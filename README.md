## C.H.I.P gaming console inspired by retroPI

Your task is to create C.H.I.P retrogame console using provided LCD screen and gamecontroller. Configure LCD screen to work with C.H.I.P and
play some DOOM or good old NES -classics! RaspberryPI project RetroPI could provide some ideas.

Focus on:
- Configuring the LCD to work well
- Provide good documentation to configure the LCD and to run games
